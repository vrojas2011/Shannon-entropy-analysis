# Shannon-entropy-analysis
This repository contains an R script (Shannon entropy data1.R) for the analysis of data from shannon entropy calculations on two respiratory samples (nasopharyngeal and tracheal). The genomic sequences of these samples were aligned and shannon entropy index was calculated with the sequence editor Bioedit. 
This project contains lines of code to select entropy values along the SARS CoV-2 genome in various sample types. Excel files table S1 and S2 contain Shannon entropy data for each nucleotide position of the SARS CoV-2 viral genome obtained from genomic sequences downloaded from NCBI. Table S1 (Nasopharyngeal Samples) and S2 (Tracheal Aspirate).
